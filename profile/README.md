## iOS development

|      CaptureSDK     |  Note |
|----------|-------|
| [CaptureSDK - Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/SocketMobile/swift-package-capturesdk) | Swift and Objective C |

NB: Our [CaptureSDK for Cocoapods](https://github.com/SocketMobile/cocoapods-capturesdk) is also available but as Cocoapods is adding a lot complexity in a Xcode project, we strongly recommend Swift Package Manager. You can also mix Swift Package Manager and Cocoapods.
There's no need to migrate all your Cocoapods to Swift Package Manager all at once.
